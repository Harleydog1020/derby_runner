## Welcome to Derby Runner, on GitHub Pages

This is an open source python project that attempts to provide a GUI interface to tables and reports to facilitate managing and scoring Scouting events like Klondike Derby.  The intention is that it be simple and straight forward so that non-technical types can have some hope at downloading, installing and running it with little or no help from a highly skilled programmer.  How close to that goal it can get will remain to be seen.  Some time has been invested.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Harleydog1020/derby_runner/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Harleydog1020/derby_runner/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
