This is an open source python project that attempts to provide a GUI interface to tables and reports to facilitate managing and scoring Scouting events like Klondike Derby.  The intention is that it be simple and straight forward so that non-technical types can have some hop at downloading, installing and running it with little or no help from a highly skilled programmer.  How close to that goal it can get will remain to be seen.  As it is in the design phase, the objects currently planned include:
*Patrols table
* Troops table
* Stations table
* Way Points table
* Routes table
* Scoring table
* Adullts table
* Youth table
* Events table

Each of these is planned to have roughly the same functionalities:
* New
* Edit
* Delete
* Print
* Export (CSV)
* Import (CSV)

Current thought is to keep each table filtered to a specific event so as not to confuse the users while they are using it.
